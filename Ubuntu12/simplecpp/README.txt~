This has the simplecpp package.

Please do not distribute.

Instructions for installing the simplecpp package:
1. Copy this directory (simplecpp) somewhere.
2. Change the directory to this, and execute
   sh configure.sh

This should create simplecpp/lib/libsprite.a which is needed in
simplecpp.  The include files will be in simplecpp/include.

It should also create simplecpp/s++

s++ is the compiler for use with simplecpp.  You can create an alias
so that you dont need to give the entire filename to use s++, or
whatever.

To use simplecpp, your source files should contain
#include <simplecpp>

------
   
Simplecpp directory contains following subdirectories:

       include : contains C++ include files

       lib     : contains libsprite.a  

       src     : source files.  But also other junk

       demos   : square.cpp, the program from chapter 1 of the book,
                 and other things eventually.
 
       Other things that may or may not be junk, but please ignore
       them.
